<p> This <code>usb.*</code> package is a Free Software
(and Open Source) library of
Java code for working with USB devices in Java.
It is distributed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">
GNU "Lesser" GPL</a> (LGPL), meaning that you can use
it in proprietary software (if you release any
modifications under LGPL or GPL).
It currently supports Linux 2.4 through use of the prototype
"usbdevfs", or remote access to an implementation through RMI,
and includes some basic application code.

<p> Look at <a href="http://www.usb.org/">www.usb.org</a> for
information about USB.  Briefly, the Universal Serial Bus is intended
to eventually replace RS-232 and parallel ports.
USB handles more types of communication than those older technologies,
supports multi-device hierarchical networks built using hubs,
and data rates are much higher than RS-232.
USB 1.1 support is available on most current computers, and
in 2001 USB 2.0 support is beginning to roll out.
So there are distinct advantages to USB.

<p> The current distribution site for this software is
<a href="http://jusb.sourceforge.net">
http://jusb.sourceforge.net</a>
and you should provide code updates
(ports, bugfixes, etc)
as described there.

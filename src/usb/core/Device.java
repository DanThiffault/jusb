/**
 * Provides access to a USB device.
 *
 * <p> To use a device, first make sure that
 * you can use its current configuration.
 * Then get the interfaces for that configuration and claim the ones
 * you want to use.  Then just use the endpoints from those interfaces.
 * You might want to switch some interfaces
 * to their alternate settings before you start using endpoints.
 *
 * <p> To provide behaviors specific to a device, or type of device,
 * wrap one of these Device objects in a class that understands how
 * to perform device-specific operations.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * <p> Except for a root hub, or when interrupted by disconnection,
 * <code><em>dev</em>.getHub().getChild(<em>dev</em>.getHubPortNum()</code>
 * is equal to <code><em>dev</em></code>.  However, it is good to avoid
 * assuming that disconnects don't happen; they can be caused just by
 * surge currents through hubs.
 * Somewhat related:  the best available view of hub parent/child
 * relationships may not always match physical reality because of an
 * inherent scheduling lag, and sometimes event reordering, that also
 * affects {@link USBListener}.

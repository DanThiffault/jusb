<p> This package has a Mac OS X implementation of a <em>usb.core.Host</em>
  object, bootstrapping support, and other classes leveraging the Mac OS X
  IOKit USB API.  The accompanying jusbMacOSX.jnilib native library passes
  usb.macosx.DeviceImpl native calls to the Mac OS X's IOKit userspace
  USB APIs. jUSB seems to wrap around the existing IOKit USB API's very
  neatly compared to Windows, which has no equivalent userspace USB API
  and thus requires custom filter drivers and IOCtl calls to be written.

<p> The rest of this package overview is a summary of Mac OS X-specific
  issues you may need to know about.

<h3>Bulk and Interrupt Messaging Support</h3>

<p> Has now been added to the native library but has not been tested thoroughly so your mileage may vary.

<h3>Do not use the Hub or PortIdentifier classes!</h3>

<p>Devices found during device scanning are registered in a flat list,
  each as the root device on its own bus. The device scanner (working
  inside the native library) does not report any hubs encountered to
  jUSB. FingerWorks found that sending descriptor requests from jUSB to
  hubs through the IOKit API causes the library to crash. </p>

<p>Nothing is known about hubs or the real USB bus topology, since Mac
  OS X does not provide a file system topology reflecting the physical USB
  hub/device hierarchy.  So the usb.core.Hub and usb.core.PortIdentifier
  classes are useless (and should be avoided!) with this Mac OS X
  implementation. However, the IOKit API does provide a 32-bit 'locator
  ID' unique to a device's physical location within the USB hub/device
  tree, which the PortIdentifier class might be adapted to use in the
  future.</p>

<p>usb.core.Device, usb.core.Descriptor, usb.core.DeviceDescriptor,
  usb.core.ControlMessage,
  usb.core.Endpoint, and usb.core.Interface should work for control
  messaging at least.</p>

<p> This package has a partial
  Windows implementation of a <em>usb.core.Host</em>
  object, bootstrapping support,
  and other classes leveraging Windows USB support.
  At this writing, only control traffic really works.

<p> The accompanying source to <em>jusbFWin.dll</em> native code
  passes userspace Windows ioctl calls to a custom 'filter' driver
  (<i>fwupdate.sys</i>) that can sit on top of a full Windows device
  driver like the composite device driver (<i>usbhub.sys</i>) or the
  generic <i>fwusbstub.sys</i>. The full driver is responsible for
  handling plugging, disconnect, and power state charges, while the
  filter driver just passes along control message URBs. The dll and
  drivers were built with Visual C++ 6.0, and currently attach only to
  FingerWorks products (vendor ID 0xe97).  To use with other devices,
  the appropriate product and vendor IDs need to be changed in the inf
  file (currently <i>fingerworks.inf</i>). Furthermore, before getting the
  windows host from HostFactory, HostFactory.setVendorIDmatchFilter(int)
  and HostFactory.setProductIDmatchFilter(int) must be called so that the
  scanForDevices(int match_vendor_id, int match_product_id) call can initialize
  the DLL to search for desired vendor and/or product.
  Specify -1 on the productID to match all products from the given vendor.
  (Specifying -1 on the vendorID will scan and expose all the devices that
  appear, but some devices may not be happy talking to our stub or filter drivers.)

<p> The rest of this package overview is a summary of Windows-specific
  issues you may need to know about.

<h3>Bulk and Interrupt Messaging Support</h3>

<p> ...does not yet exist, but adding it to the DLL and filter driver
  should be straightforward. Just need to add appropriate ioctl's with
  properly-formatted URBs. The existing DLL only supports standard
  descriptor requests and vendor control requests.

<h3> </h3>

<h3>Do not use the Hub or PortIdentifier classes!</h3>

<p>Devices found during driver scanning are registered in a flat list,
  each as
  the root device on its own bus. Nothing is known about hubs or the real
  USB bus topology, since Windows hides hubs behind its <i>usbhub.sys</i>
  driver, and unlike Linux's usbdevfs, does not provide a file system
  topology reflecting the physical USB hub/device hierarchy. So the
  usb.core.Hub and usb.core.PortIdentifier classes are useless (and
  should be avoided!) with this current Windows implementation.  However,
  usb.core.Device, usb.core.Descriptor, usb.core.DeviceDescriptor,
  usb.core.ControlMessage, usb.core.Endpoint, and usb.core.Interface
  should work for control messaging at least.</p>

<h3><a name="threads">Threading and Device Detection Issues</a></h3>

<p> The Watcher thread within usb.windows.Windows calls out to the DLL
  every second
  or so via <i>scanForDevices</i>() to scan for removal or attachment
  of devices.  The dll calls back <i>newDeviceAvailable</i>() or
  <i>existingDeviceRemoved</i>() on the same thread for each device
  change. If the filter driver <i>fwupdate.sys </i>is not yet installed
  for a detected FingerWorks device on a particular port (yes, Windows
  must re-register a device for each port :(, the dll also invokes
  <i>fingerworks.inf </i>to install the appropriate drivers. This may
  take awhile, and cause various driver installation wizards to pop up
  for user approval.

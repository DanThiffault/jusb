<p> This package provides a USB Host Driver Interface,
letting Java programs access USB Devices from USB Hosts.
The initial implementation is of course for the
<a href="../linux/package-summary.html">GNU/Linux</a> OS,
but alternative operating systems (such as Win32) could also
be supported through an appropriate server implementation.
Some currently notable aspects of this API include:  <ul>

    <li> Open Source.  The libraries are under the "Lesser" GPL (LGPL),
    which means you can use them in proprietary products as well as in
    Free Software projects.

    <li> Provides multi-threaded access to multiple
    physical USB Devices.

    <li> Supports access to native or remote devices.

    <li> Devices with multiple interface can support multiple
    drivers; each claims a different interface.

    <li> Synchronous control and bulk messaging are well supported;
    interrupt messaging is in development.
    
    <li> You can enumerate devices, and receive notifications when devices
    (or USB controllers) are added or removed.

    </ul>

<p> Simple example programs are available,
and a more substantial and useful application is available at
<a href="http://jphoto.sourceforge.net">jphoto.sourceforge.net</a>.
JPhoto exposes USB "class driver" functionality as an API and tool,
for "Digital Still Imaging" devices (cameras and more).

<p> At this writing, two implementations of this interface
are available.  One uses the Linux 2.4 kernel; the other
uses RMI.  That should reduces the number of porting problems,
as well as enabling application development on any platform
that has sufficient Java support.
The relevant Service Provider Interface (SPI) is not for applications
use, and is subject to change.


<h3> Overview of Device Selection, Setup, and Use </h3>

<p> To use a device, you first need to find it.  In this API,
the file system is not used to discover or identify devices.
If you're using the Java API, you'll likely need to use
one or more <a href="Endpoint.html">Endpoint</a>s to
do your I/O; but you need to get them first! </p> <ol>

    <li> Bootstrap by getting a USB <a href="Host.html">Host</a>
    from the <a href="HostFactory.html">HostFactory</a>.

    <li> Then get a <a href="Device.html">Device</a>.
    Given a host, you have several choices here, all of
    which can give you access to a device in "operational"
    mode (no further setup is required):<ul>

	<li> You can address devices at specific hub ports using the
	<a href="PortIdentifier.html">PortIdentifier</a> class.
	Such port IDs won't change unless you recable.

	<li> To find out about devices which are currently connected,
	ask the host about its <a href="Bus.html">Bus</a>ses.

	<li> Ask the Host to notify you about them as they connect,
	using a <a href="USBListener.html">USBListener</a>.

	<li> Walk up or down a USB tree from a device you have.

	</ul>

    <li> Look at the Device and its current
    <a href="Configuration.html">Configuration</a>
    to see if it's one that you want to deal with; there might
    be many similar devices to use.

    </ol>

<p> Once you have such a device, interact directly with it
using control messaging, or use 
<a href="Endpoint.html">Endpoint</a>s
to transport data in various ways.
To get an endpoint,
claim an <a href="Interface.html">Interface</a>,
from its Configuration,
and then you may use its endpoints.
Get interfaces from the current configuration,
and keep track of whether you've claimed them. </p>

<p> In the "interface claiming" process, other drivers may be able
to claim the interface before your Java code.
 As yet there's no way to ask another
module to release its claim on an interface, much less to do
so in your favor.  You can tell which driver claimed an interface.
<em>Note:  you don't claim devices, only interfaces.
Devices can be shared between drivers, with
interfaces as the nonsharable unit.</em>
</p>

<h3> Device Driver Modes </h3>

<p> USB offers a lot of flexibility in how functionality is structured
in different devices.
At this writing, two of those mechanisms should be avoided in
this API:  multiple configurations, and alternate settings for
interfaces.  (Most devices don't use these, so temporarily
avoiding that USB functionality should be no real hardship.)

<p> Some interesting driver modes include: 

<ul>

    <li> Some applications may may get substantial work done
    without claiming any interface.  They may only be visible
    except to the extent that they use control messaging.

    <li> Some drivers may provide standard USB <em>Class</em>
    functionality such as a hub, keyboard, or still imaging device.

    <li> Other drivers may support some vendor-specific
    functionality.  Device characteristics such as
    vendor number and product number help
    determine what drivers might talk to the device.
    These drivers are typically associated with a lists
    of devices they handle, which evolves over time.

    </ul> 

<p> You may find that a driver you have written for one type of
device can work with another one.  Often new models retain protocol
compatibility with older ones.  So, manage the lists of devices supported
by your driver carefully, and try to make it so that end users can
update the lists easily (use some text config file, perhaps XML).


<h3> USB Communication Types </h3>

<p> Each USB device supports four types of communication.  One of them can
be used with every device, and is implicitly available with every
interface.  (Called the "default control pipe" or "endpoint zero".) <ul>

    <li><a href="ControlMessage.html"><em>Control</em></a>
    messaging (no endpoint type) is used in request/response messages
    to devices, and are used for device management.  They can be used to
    access the device's identification information (identifying device
    type, manufacturer, product, perhaps a serial number, and more).
    Drivers share access to such "command style" communications to the
    device, and there may be extended periods where they must exclude
    access from other drivers.

    </ul>

<p> Other types of communication are grouped in "interfaces".  Interfaces
have at least one "endpoint", used to describe one of the
other three types of communication: <ul>

    <li><a href="#bulk"><em>Bulk</em></a> endpoints are reliable.
    They have some reserved bandwidth, and also take up what's left
    at the end of a USB frame, after periodic transfers.
    They are used in storage units
    such as high-capacity removable disks, flash memory readers,
    in still imaging devices (scanners,
    cameras), in MP3 players to transfer data to or from the USB device,
    in network interfaces,
    and in other kinds of devices.</li>

    <li><a href="#interrupt"><em>Interrupt</em></a>
    endpoints preallocate a certain amount of
    bandwidth for periodic (every N frames of USB traffic)
    use in communicating events from the device to the USB
    host (or sometimes vice versa, as in a force feedback
    joystick).  Examples include mouse movements and
    key presses; at most 64 bytes of data can be transferred each interrupt.
    (Note that these are not real interrupts.  The USB host polls each
    device for interrupt data, with a period chosen by the endpoint.)</li>

    <li> <em>Isochronous</em> endpoints (<em>iso</em> for short) are not
    currently supported in this package.  These are used for media data such
    as sound (to speakers or a headset; from a microphone) and video (most
    of the USB "webcams" use this).
    These are periodic unreliable transfers,
    typically larger than interrupt data.
    Such media often have OS support that is automatically used by the
    Java Media APIs, and need little user mode support. </li>

    </ul>

<p> It's likely that features using isochronous endpoints could leverage
the real time extensions to Java, or be exposed through higher level APIs
such as the Java Media Framework (JMF).  Such support has not been the
top priority for this package thus far.  </p>


<h4><a name="bulk">Bulk Messaging</a></h4>

<p> If you have a bulk input endpoint, it is associated with a 
<code>java.io.InputStream</code> which you can read and write as you need.
If you have a bulk output endpoint, it provides you with a 
<code>java.io.OutputStream</code>.  Only high speed devices
use bulk messaging.

<p> Note that there are no limits to the amount of data you can send or
receive through a bulk endpoint, other than elapsed time it takes to send
the data.
Unlike TCP, there are packet boundaries; you can send packets of up
to a per-endpoint maximum (such as 64 bytes, the biggest) and you
can detect "short" reads (less than the maximum, including
zero bytes) through the API.

<p> USB 1.1 is nominally at 12 Megabit/second speed,
and USB 2.0 is nominally at 480 Megabit/second,
but your host controller or OS may limit your throughput.
You can help the USB Host
Controller Driver (HCD) get top throughput by using larger writes.


<h4><a name="interrupt">Interrupt Endpoints</a></h4>

<p> You may send interrupt data to a device at any time using
<code>Endpoint.sendInterrupt</code>, sending data to
the device (maximum of 64 bytes, but check the specific
endpoint size limit).

<p> To receive interrupts from a device, dedicate a thread
to issue <code>Endpoint.recvInterrupt</code>, and do at least partial
processing of the interrupt data provided by device.  (This threading
model and API is highly subject to change.
It's not debugged yet, for one thing; likely a user mode timer
should just do the polling, to simplify the kernel interaction.)


<h3> Other API Notes </h3>

<p> In most places the USB specification defines values to be
unsigned eight or sixteen bit units, they are exposed in this
API using (signed) <code>int</code> values.
In places where values are defined as BCD encoded release
numbers, they are exposed as strings.

<p> USB numbers things starting at one.  This means that
this API uses one-based ranges for things such as port
numbers and USB addresses.

<p> In places where the USB specification defines values to be string
index descriptor numbers, they are exposed here as strings.
Device strings may of course be cached at various
levels of the system.  You can facilitate this by asking to
use a default language;
just pass zero where language codes are required.
(The Linux implementation uses its system locale when choosing
among a selection of languages; other native implementations
might consider other factors.) </li>
